# ATM-Exercise

## Description
This is a programming exercise, using React and JSX, to demonstrate building the basic UI components and logic for an ATM. Using our faculty's set of instructional videos as a guide, this ATM app allows (requires) the user to select an action ("Deposit" or "Cash Back") before being allowed to proceed to entering an amount. Additionally, the ATM logic validates the amount input, in order to prevent an overdraft on the account balance. In addition to the features created in the instructional videos, I primarily implemented some styling improvements, giving the UI a retro monochrome screen. I also imported a Google Font, called 'IBM Plex Mono'. Future improvements to the functionality are listed below, under Roadmap.

## Installation / Usage
Download all of the files within this repository, and load the index.html file in a web browser. This app can run while hosted either on a local or remote web server. For a live preview, you can run the index.html file in this repo, directly, by visting this URL: https://dcdiaz.github.io/ATM-Exercise/

## Roadmap
- Add a specific "Insufficient Funds" alert message when attempting to withdraw more than the total account balance.
- Dispense real cash. (jk)
